## Description

All sports fans have their favorite team or teams. The goal of this feature is to allow registered users to customize the Team hub where they will see news related only to their favorite teams. In case users do not select their favorite teams, they see news about the teams from their geolocation.
The team list available for users to follow is created by admin user.

## Check list:

  - Verify if UI corresponds to the prototype
  - Logged-in users should be able to select favorite teams
  - Logged-in users should be able to read news about favorite teams
  - Logged-in users should be able to unfollow a team
  - Geolocation should work and logged-in users should be able to select related teams
