  And I see the <b>Open</b> tab contains:
    - Question
    - Status (Not published, Published)
    - Actions (for Published: Close; for Not published: Publish)
    - Responses â€“ the number of people who passed the survey
    - Delete icon for each row
  And I see unpublished surveys are at the top of the list

When I click <b>+ New Survey</b>
Then I see a new survey form on the right side that contains
  - A text field for a question, required field
  - A calendar icon to select a period for voting, required and cannot be selected for the past date
  - Input field for answer option, required field
  - Link button to add one more answer option
  - <b>Cancel</b> and <b>Save</b> buttons

Then I see the survey is saved to the database in the <b>Not published</b> state
  And I see a survey question appears at the top of the list on the <b>Open</b> tab

When I click on the <b>Not published</b> survey on the <b>Open</b> tab
Then I see the survey read-only details in the <b>Reader pool</b> on the right side
  And I see the <b>Delete</b> and <b>Edit</b> buttons
