## Description

    As an admin user
    I want to be able to close the surveys

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: An admin user closes a survey</i></b>

Given I am logged in as an admin user

When I am on the <b>Surveys</b> page and view the <b>Open</b> tab
Then I see the <b>Close</b> action for surveys in <b>Published</b> state

When I click <b>Close</b>
Then I see a success message
  And I see the survey is moved to the <b>Closed</b> tab and is not available for users

When the survey configured end day has passed
Then I see the survey is automaticaly moved to <b>Closed</b> tab and is not available for users

When I go to the <b>Closed</b> tab
Then I see a list of closed surveys that contain:
  - Question
  - Closed date
  - Responses â€“ the number of people who passed the survey
  - Delete icon for each row

When I click on any survey on the <b>Closed</b> tab
Then I see survey read-only details in <b>Reader pool</b> on the right side without any action buttons
  And I see the progress bars for each answer

When I hover over the survey in the list
Then I see a <b>Delete</b> icon

When I click on the <b>Delete</b> icon
Then I see a confirmation dialog

When I confirm delete on the confirmation dialog
Then I see a success message
  And I see the survey is removed from the list
