## Description

    As a site user 
    I want to be able to navigate to the sport subcategory page of the Sport News site using the Navigation menu
    So that I can see news about selected subcategory

## Acceptance criteria

    Scenario: A site user navigates to the sport subcategory page of the Sport News site using the Navigation menu
    Given I am logged in as a site user

    When I hover over any of the navigation menu item (category)
    Then I see a mega dropdown menu with the subcategories available in that category
      (For example if I hover the NFL sport category
      And I see a navigation dropdown is opened with a list of the following subcategories: AFC East, AFC North, AFC South, AFC West, NFC East, NFC North, NFC South, NFC West)
      And I see these subcategories appear and the order in which they appear in the Content Management System (Information Architecture section)
    When I click on the navigation menu subcategory item
    Then I am taken to the landing page for that subcategory
    When I view a page within a subcategory of the site 
    Then I see a corresponding navigation menu category item is set to its active state (highlighted)
