## Description

There should be a Navigation menu visible on every page of the Sport News site in the left side of every page. The Navigation menu consists of the following menu items:<br>
    - HOME<br>
    - NFL<br>
    - NBA<br>
    - MLB<br>
    - NHL<br>
    - CBB<br>
    - CFB<br>
    - NASCAR<br>
    - GOLF<br>
    - SOCCER<br>
    - LIFESTYLE<br>
    - DEALBOOK<br>
    - VIDEO<br>
    - TEAM HUB<br>
    - Follow on social block (Facebook, Twitter, Google +, Youtube)<br>
The HOME, LIFESTYLE, DEALBOOK, VIDEO and TEAM HUB menu items are static categories. The NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, CBB, CFB, NASCAR, GOLF and SOCCER are sport categories configurable by Admin. Site admin can add as many sport categories as he prefers. If there are more than eight sport categories configured than there should be a scroll added to the menu section.   
Some of the sport categories are divided into subcategories. The subcategories contain a list of the teams related to the subcategory. 
For example the NFL sport category consists of the following subcategories: AFC East, AFC North, AFC South, AFC West, NFC East, NFC North, NFC South, NFC West. The AFC South contains the following teams: Houston, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Tennessee
When a logged in user hovers over the category in the main navigation menu that consists of the subcategories, then this category is highlighted and a mega dropdown menu with links to the subcategories appear in the UI. When a logged in user clicks on the subcategory, he is redirected to the subcategory page
When a logged in user hovers over the subcategory in the secondary navigation menu that consists of the teams, then this subcategory is highlighted and a dropdown menu with list of teams appears in the UI. When a logged in user clicks on the team, he is redirected to the team page
The LIFESTYLE, DEALBOOK, VIDEO and TEAM HUB Navigation menu categories donâ€™t have subcategories, so when a logged in user hovers over one of these categories, then this category is only highlighted. When a logged in user clicks on one of these categories, he is redirected to the appropriate category page
Admin user configures a list of categories, subcategories and teams visible in the Navigation panel
