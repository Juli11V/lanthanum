## Description

    As a site user
    I want to be able to login using a third-party authentication provider

## Acceptance criteria

    Scenario: A site user logins using Facebook or Google
    Given I have registered to the portal with Facebook or Google account

    When I visit the login page of the site
    Then I see Google and Facebook icons above the form
      And when I click on the Google or Facebook icons
    Then I see my name provided by selected third-party authentication provider instead of Login link and Log out link in the drop-down menu next to my name
    When I click on the drop-down menu next to my name
    Then I see information about provider I used to login
      And I see My Surveys, Team Hub, and Log Out links
    When I click on My Surveys
    Then I am taken to my My Surveys page
      And I see 2 tabs:
        - My Surveys
        - Team Hub
      And My Surveys is active
