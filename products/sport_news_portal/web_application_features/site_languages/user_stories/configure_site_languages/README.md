## Description

    As an admin user
    I want to configure a list of available site languages 
    So user can select the preferred language for the Sport News site

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
Scenario: An admin user configures the list of available site languages
Given I am logged in as an admin user

When I view the <b>Languages</b> configuration page
Then I see a table with the list of languages available for the Sport News site and a language status toggle

When I hover over some language
Then I see the <b>Delete</b> icon

When I click on the <b>Delete</b> icon
Then I see the language is deleted from the list

When I hover over the English language
Then I do not see the Delete icon

When I switch the language status toggle (<i>present for any language except English</i>)
Then I see the language is activated or deactivated
<i>Note: When language is in the deactivated state, itâ€™s not shown in the drop-down list with site languages in the site header</i>

When I view the Language configuration page
Then in the upper-right corner of the page, I see the <b>New Language</b> button

When I click <b>New Language</b>
Then I see the <b>Add Language</b> pop-up window with the multi-select input with checkboxes, the <b>Add</b> and <b>Cancel</b> buttons

When I select the list of languages that I want to make available on the site and click <b>Add</b>
Then I see new languages are displayed in the languages list

When I click the <b>Cancel</b> button in the <b>Add Language</b> pop-up window
Then I see the pop-up window is closed and no new languages appear in the language list
