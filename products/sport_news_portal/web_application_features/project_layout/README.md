## Description

Create a Sport News site project layout structure that will be common for any of the pages:
  - site header section
  - site footer section
  - site main navigation section on the left side
  - a main content area section
  - right sidebar section
Also, there should be a special behavior of the site logo - it should be a link to a Home page and external links if any should open in a new tab.
Please note, pages content blocks will be configured by the admin.

## Check list:

  - Verify if UI corresponds to prototype
  - Logged in user should be navigated to the Home page clicking on Logo
  - Layout structure should be the same across all the pages
  - The third party site should be opened in a separate browser tab when user click on an external link
  - Pages should be built from content blocks that are configured by the admin
