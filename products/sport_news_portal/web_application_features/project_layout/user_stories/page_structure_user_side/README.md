## Description

    As a site user
    I want to view the same layout structure across all the pages

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: A site user views layout structure across all the pages</i></b>

Given I am a site user

When I view any page on the site
Then I see the page consists of:
  - Header section that is common for all pages, includes:
    1. Social network icons (configured by the admin)
    2. Global search box
    3. Sport News logo
    4. Sign up and Log in buttons (in case user is not logged in) 
    5. User name, Profile picture, and profile link (in case user is logged in)
    6. Site language drop-down menu (language list is configured by the admin)
  - Main navigation sidebar menu on the left that is common to all pages
  - The main content area with content blocks, configured by the admin
  - Right sidebar with content blocks, configured by the admin 
  - Footer section that is common to all pages, configured by the admin

When I click on the <b>Sport News</b> logo
Then I am taken to the Sport News home page 
  And I see the <b>Home</b> menu item is active

When I click on a link to an external site 
Then I see the site is opened on a new browser tab
