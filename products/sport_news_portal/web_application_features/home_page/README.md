## Description

When users visit our site, they should see the main page by default. The main page is called Home in the navigation menu. This page should contain the most recent news and topics, and consist of the following page sections:
  - Main articles: Admin can add at least 1 and up to 5 articles to the section. These articles will be rotating every 3 seconds. This section needs to be always present and users can not hide it from the page. Users can click on the article number to make a rotation to it. Rotation will continue from this article. The section is always present and can not be hidden.
  - Breakdown: Admin can show or hide this section on the page. The Breakdown section has to consist of breakdowns with 2-4 articles. 
Admin user can show and hide the following sections:
  - Photo of the day
  - Most popular
  - Most commented
We want to allow the admin user to configure this page, post articles, photos, and make some parts of the page visible or nonvisible.
The Most popular and Most commented functionality is described in [the separate feature](/products/sport_news_portal/web_application_features/home_page/user_stories/most_popular_and_commented).
