Admin also can use the language selector to change the site content. English language is default and cannot be removed or disabled for users.

## Check list:

- A drop-down list with available site languages should be present in the right section of the site header for admin
- Site content should be translated into the chosen language
- Admin should be able to add, delete, enable, and disable a language in the drop-down list
