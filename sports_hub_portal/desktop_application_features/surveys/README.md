## Description

To gather information from sports fans and build statistics, we need to have functionality that will allow us to create questionnaires.

An admin user should be able to create, edit, delete, and close surveys with predefined answers, send them to users and review voting results.

## Check list:

  - Verify if UI corresponds to the prototype
  - Admin should be able to create, edit, delete, and close a survey
  - Admin should be able to send a survey to users
  - Admin should be able to review voting results
